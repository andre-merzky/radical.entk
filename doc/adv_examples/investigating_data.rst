Investigating intermediate data
*******************************

It is important to be able to investigate data generated by the tasks of the
application. One way to do this is to download the data to the local machine
using the 'download_output_data' property of the kernel. If a kernel is not
to be used, each of the patterns have two functions 'get_output' and 'get_file'
that can be used to extract the (standard) output of a task or download a 
particular file generated by a task.

In order to get the standard output of a particular task, the user needs to
use the get_output() method along with the specification of the task, stage and
iteration numbers as arguments to the method.

.. code-block:: python

    self.get_output(task, stage, iteration)


In order to get a specific file of a particular task, the user needs to use the 
get_file() method along with the specification of the task, stage, iteration
numbers, the name of the file at the source and optionally a new name for the 
file at the destination.

.. code-block:: python

    self.get_file(task, stage, iteration, filename, new_name)


A complete example using both these function is available below for both
the patterns.
