- **Application Kernels**: `Application Kernels` describe a task that is executed 
  on a remote cluster (execution environment). For example, if you want to 
  run AMBER or NAMD with a specific set of input data, you define this as an
  Application Kernel. Application Kernels aim to hide tool-specific 
  peculiarities accross different clusters as well as differences between the 
  interfaces of the various MD tools to the extend possible.

- **Application Logic**: As `Application Logic` we describe the data- and 
  control-flow between the application kernels in a pattern. While the control-flow
  is defined by the pattern, the data flow is defined by the input / output 
  data connection.

- **Application Workload**: The `Application Workload` is the computational 
  work that is generated by an Ensemble MD Toolkit application.
  Application Kernels are internally translated into sequential and/or MPI tasks 
  which are then submitted to a remote cluster (execution environment) for
  execution. These tasks we call the workload of (or generated by) an application.
